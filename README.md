# SuperAnnotate Hexagon Annotation Task

This project creates a **hexagon annotation** on an image using SuperAnnotate’s Python SDK and the official **Modern Image Project format**.

---

## Branch Strategy

The project uses two separate branches to isolate logic testing from API interactions:

| Branch           | Purpose                                  | SA API Calls | Image Required |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| `main`           | Local testing with mock data (no API)     | No           | No             |
| `sa-api-version` | Full flow using SuperAnnotate SDK         | Yes          | Yes (in `images/`) |

> This approach ensures API rate limits are respected and testing can be done offline.

## Contents

- `superannotate_task.py` – Main Python script
- `images/sample3.jpg` – Local image used in API flow
- `sample3.json` – Annotation JSON generated by the script
- `exported_annotations/` – Programmatically downloaded annotations
- `.env` – Stores your SA token (excluded from GitHub)
- `requirements.txt` – Reproducible dependency list

---

## Steps Performed

1. Create Image Project of type `Vector`
2. Add annotation class: `Hexagon` (polygon)
3. Attach an image via URL
4. Generate hexagon points dynamically based on image dimensions
5. Upload the annotation using the SDK
6. Mark the image as `Completed`
7. Save the annotation locally
8. Download the annotation using the SDK for verification

---

## Annotation Format

The annotation JSON follows SuperAnnotate’s official schema:

- `metadata`: includes name, width, height, and status
- `instances`: holds the hexagon polygon
- `tags`: optional
- `comments`: empty by default

---

## Validation

The image was uploaded and the annotation was created using:

```python
sa.upload_annotations(project=..., annotations=[...])
